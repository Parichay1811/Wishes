        "Your marriage hasn’t been about perfection; it’s been about patience, understanding, and choosing each other even after the fights, the debates, and the “I’m right, no I’m right” moments 😄. From laughing over the smallest things to standing strong during challenging days, you’ve shown what real partnership looks like.",
        "Your life together is proof that love isn’t just about romance it’s about teamwork, compromise, shared snacks, stolen smiles, and occasionally forgiving each other for being annoying (very important skill 😉).",
        "As you celebrate four incredible years, I wish you many more filled with surprises, happiness, inside jokes, adventures, and yes a few harmless arguments to keep things interesting. May your love continue to grow stronger, deeper, and funnier with each passing year.",
        "Happy 4th Anniversary to a couple who proves that love, laughter, and a little madness make the best marriage ❤️🥂",
